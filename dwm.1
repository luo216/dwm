.TH DWM 1 dwm\-VERSION
.SH NAME
dwm \- dynamic window manager (scroll fork)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. This fork replaces the master/stack
layout with a horizontal scroll layout and a built-in status bar.
.P
Windows are grouped by nine tags (1-9). Each window belongs to exactly one tag,
and each monitor shows one tag at a time. The scroll layout arranges tiled
clients in a horizontal strip for the active tag; floating clients stay above.
Focus the next/previous tiled client with Mod1\-j / Mod1\-k (floating clients
are skipped) or pan with the mouse wheel on the tab/title area. When only one
tiled client exists, Mod1\-space toggles between a full fill and a centered 3:2
window. The alternate layout is floating.
.P
The bar shows a super icon, the focused window class (or fallback text), the tag
list, the layout glyph, per-client tabs for the current tag, status widgets
(notify, battery, clock, net, CPU, per-core load, temperature, memory, menu),
and a scaled system tray. dwm draws and updates the status itself; xsetroot is
not used.
